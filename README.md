# The Development of Indonesian Political Ideology Scale

This project aims to develop new, comprehensive scale to measure Indonesians' political ideology. We also measured right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, religious zeal, dark triad, and light triad to estimate the construct validity of the scale. This study is consisted of two-wave surveys (October 2018 and March 2019), just a few months before 2019 Presidential Election. We intend to perform a second-order confirmatory factor analysis, a latent growth curve model, and a latent profile analysis.

This project is funded by the Directorate General of Higher Education (DGHE).
